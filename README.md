## Data Description: 
MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota.
## Domain: 
Entertainment and Internet
## Context:
The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. The data is widely used for collaborative filtering and other filtering solutions. However, we will be using this data to act as a means to demonstrate our skill in using Python to “play” with data.
## Learning Outcomes: 
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Visualization using Python
* Pandas
## Objective:
To Demonstrate your skill in python for data analysis.

There is need to import 3 files from the folder as data frames into your Jupyter notebook
* u.data 
* u.item
* u.user
## Task
* Display univariate plots of the attributes: 'rating', 'age', 'release date', 'gender' and 'occupation', from their respective data frames
* Visualize how popularity of Genres has changed over the years. From the graph one should be able to see for any given year, movies of which genre got released the most.
* Display the top 25 movies by average rating, as a list/series/dataframe.
Note:- Consider only the movies which received atleast a 100 ratings
* Verify the following statements (no need of doing a statistical test. Compare absolute numbers):
* Men watch more drama than women
